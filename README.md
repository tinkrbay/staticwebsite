This is a Responsive HTML template that gives a slightly higher appeal as opposed to a simple index.html
Note that this is still a static website
You do not have any server side processing like PHP, Node.js, Python or Ruby on Rails 
This is a set of HTML code jazzed up to decorate the website look and feel
Neither there is any database involved here
In a nutshell, index.html pepped up to give a better look and feel
The index.html primarily serves as the landing page and has HTML code including client-side javascripts that will supplied to your browser
The images used are stored in the img directory
Play around if you like to customize (logos/text/images, etc...)
